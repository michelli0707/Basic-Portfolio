<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr>

<img src="C:\Users\Jenny\Desktop\Basic-Portfolio\Assets\Images/Profile Picture.jpg">

<p>My name is Michelli Chaves Vieira. I am currently learning programming languages to become a full stack Web Developer at the Coding Boot Camp offered at SMU in Dallas TX. My interest in coding comes from my general interest in technology and the desire to focus my career in software development and sales.
</p>
<p>I have a major in International Business and Economics, and currently hold FINRA Series 7 and 66 certifications (Financial Services industry).    
</p>
<p>I have a solid work background, with 10 years of experience in new Business Development and Sales, both nationally and internationally, where I successfully sold Bloomberg software and networking technology (optical transport and data) products to Director, VP and C-level executives in the Fortune 500 and 1000 lists.   
</p>
<p>I have developed new business in both the United States and the European Union, working with International Carriers, Telecom Operators, Cable MSOs and Colocation companies as well as International Banks, Broker-Dealers, Hedge Funds and Family Offices.
